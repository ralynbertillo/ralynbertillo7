        <h2>SPEAK UP FOR THOSE WHO CAN'T SPEAK FOR THEMSELVES</h2>
        <p class="bodyText"> Let me grab this chance to use this website as a way for my advocacy on animal welfare and rights. In the world today, people cannot do without
            animals because they have become an essential part of human existence to both vegetarians and meat eaters. Some animals serve as pet, and some serve  as
            food, and others are used for sports and laboratory experiments. Although some animal activist advocates for , there are limits to that right because
            animals cannot be equal with human. They don’t have the intellectual ability that humans have to take responsibilities and control what happens around them.<p>
        
        <p class="bodyText"> These animals are important in the society and the need to treat them with respect is paramount. Animals used as food should be treated and killed humanely; they 
            should not be allowed to go through pains or any form of ill-treatment. They sever as companion, security, medical discovery, prevention and cure of diseases, and 
            have the necessary nutrients that help in the development of nails and hair in human. Those used as food animals should be slaughtered humanely and not allowed to go
            through pains or any form of ill-treatment. Those that serve as pets should be treated well. </p>

        <p class="bodyText"> Many animal lovers think animals don't just deserve protection in a paternalistic way. They say that animals have rights that must be respected. Rights are much
            more important than interests, because rights impose a burden on others that the other parties must accept. If animals do have rights then there are certain things that
            human beings should not do to animals, because doing them would violate the animal's rights. This applies regardless of the cost to human beings. If humanity must suffer
            some disadvantage as the consequence of respecting animal rights, then that's the way it has to be.</p>

        <p class="bodyText"> Animal welfare refers to the quality of life experienced by an animal and encompasses how well the animal is coping with his or her current situation and surroundings. World
            Animal Protection believes animal welfare is affected by the relationships human beings have with animals and it is our duty to ensure all animals are treated humanely, responsibly,
            and with respect.This includes consideration for all aspects of animal well-being. Animal welfare is important because there are so many animals around the world suffering from
            being used for entertainment, food, medicine, fashion, scientific advancement, and as exotic pets. Every animal deserves to have a good life.</p>

        <p class="bodyText"> I would like to reinterate that my topic is to create awareness among the people about care, management and nutrition of pets as well as stray animals. I believe that animals have
            feelings like humans too so, caring about animal welfare is kindhearted thing to do.Animals are planets most vulnerable inhabitats so, they deserve our strongest support and are entitled 
            for the right to enjoy life and liberty.Some people think that it’s a waste of time to worry about animals and that people are more important but, we can try to help animals and people both
            at the same time.</p>
